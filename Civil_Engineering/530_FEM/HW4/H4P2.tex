\section{Problem 2}
\textit{Problem statement:} Show that the element stiffness matrix defined as $[K^e]=\int_{\Omega_e }[B^e]^TE[B^e]dx $ is not invertible by providing one example of a non-zero vector that is in the kernel of $[K^e]$.
\\

So we want to find a ${v}$ such that $[K^e]{v}=0$. This yields, 
$$[K^e]{v}=\int_{\Omega_e }[B^e]^TE[B^e]{v}dx  $$ 
Just looking at the $[B^e]v$ portion we can expand this out to see that we have
$$[N_1' \dots N_q'][v^e] $$
where $v$ is a column vector of dimension $q$, so $v=\icol{v_1 \\  \vdotswithin{}\\ v_q}$.

There we get 
$$[N_1' \dots N_q']\icol{v_1 \\  \vdotswithin{}\\ v_q} =  N_1'v_1 + \dots N_q'v_1$$
Here we are summing up the $N_i'$s which we calculated earlier to be equal to zero.
Hence if we allow $v$ to simply be a vector of a single constant $v=\icol{c \\  \vdotswithin{}\\ c}$

Thus we have $c\sum{N_i'} = 0$.

Therefore any $v$ vector that is just constants will be in the kernel of $[K]$.
